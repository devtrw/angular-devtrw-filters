angular-devtrw-filters
===

This provides common angular filters used in DevTRW projects.


Installation
===

1. Install the source files using bower: `bower install angular-devtrw-filters`
2. Include either source file in `dist/`, they are both the same.

  __Note:__ _Both files have the same content however one has a hash of the file appended to 
  the filename and will change with each version. The revisioned filename is referenced in 
  the `main` section of the contained `bower.json` for use with automated build tools._
3. Include the `dtrw.filters` module (or the specific filter module needed) in your Angular app

Usage
===

Use the filters like you would use any other angualr filter. See the 
[Angular Filter Docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/filter) for more information.
